        <h2>About Socotra:</h2>
        <p> 
            <span><strong>Socotra</strong>, the hidden island.</span> <br>
            It is a remote and stunningly unique island archipelago located between <br> 
            the Indian Ocean and the Arabic see, belonging to Yemen. <br>
            Its long isolation from mainland Africa and the Arabian Peninsula has resulted <br>
            in an extraordinary level of biodiversity and endemism, leading to its nickname, <br>
            "the Galápagos of the Indian Ocean."
        </p>
        <p>Socotra is adminidtratively part of Hadramout Governorate, and it's about 350 KM <br>
        away from Almukala city (the capital of the governorate), and it's total area is <br>
        about 3650 Square KM .
        </p>
        <p>
            What makes Socotrians special is that they have a unique strange language <br>
            - language not accent - called the Socotrian language , while  it's actually <br>
            one of the Hymarite Semitic languages.
